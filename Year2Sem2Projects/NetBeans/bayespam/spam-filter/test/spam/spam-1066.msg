Confessions of a successful stock options junkie:

What would you do if you had developed a stock options trading strategy that consistently could earn over 100% a year, in good years and bad?  Would you tell the world about it, as I have, or would you keep the secret all to yourself?

I have written a report which shows how I made over 126% in a single year trading options on Fannie Mae while the stock fell by over 8%. This free report is available at my website.  It explains my strategy in detail. 

My name is Dr. Terry Allen.  I graduated from the Harvard Business School and have traded stock options for almost 25 years.  For the past 5 years, I have given away over $1,000 every day to Vermont charities – here’s a list of the charities that I have supported.

Many people think I’m a little nuts.  However, in the first 10 months of 2003, I made over 140% on my investment in QQQ options.  I have shared with my subscribers every trade I made before I made it so they could mirror my trades if they wished.  Many of them have been duplicating my trades, and send me letters of thanks every day. 

Maybe you think I am a little nuts yourself.  Why would I be running a stock options advisory website and giving away my trading secrets if they really worked?  Why wouldn’t I just use them myself?  Why am I still working in the first place? 

In my defense, I would say that I am a teacher at heart.  For the past 40 years, I have taught graduate level business courses at Babson College, Northeastern University, New Hampshire College, The University of Vermont, and The University of Richmond.  I absolutely love to teach about my favorite subject which happens to be stock options. 

Way back in 1979, I acquired a seat on the CBOE and traded on the floor of the exchange.  I really got hooked on trading stock options, and have traded them virtually every trading day since.  Over the years, I have developed a strategy that works in both up and down markets.  And I invite you to check it out yourself. 

My website is sort of an options primer for people who are not familiar with the wonderful world of stock options.  But the real meat is in the free stock options strategy report which is yours for the asking. 

In addition to this free report and signing up for my free newsletter, I invite you to write and ask me any questions you might have about stock options in general, or my strategy in particular. 

I look forward to sharing my passion for making money in stock options with you.

Testimonials:

“I am not a writer of flattering letters to advisors, so it is of some consequence in my investing history that I tell you how happy I am with your 10k Strategy. I hope to make it grow into the most significant part of my investments and eventually rule the world. I will be benevolent towards you, Terry, in appreciation for your brilliance and willingness to let former small fries like myself get in on the action.”  Ralph W. 9/03

"Thanks for taking the time to clarify my understanding on the ratio question - you don't get this quality of service much anymore. You earned the kind words...keep up the good work. Thanks."  Don M. 9/03

“Your strategy is paying off for me, an average of 18.5% gain per month since I started. Yahoo!!!!”  Richard A. (Australia, 9/03)

"I was one of your first subscribers, and have mirrored every trade you made in 2003. I am 73 years young, and this is the first time in my investing lifetime that I doubled my entire investment in a single year, and, as you know, we did it in only eight months."  Charlie S., Plant City, Florida 9/03

“I just wanted to let you know that the 10K strategy has worked wonders for me. In this ideal environment of little change in the DOW recently I have done very well. In June, with the DOW at 9200 I invested $48,000. Since then I currently have an account value of around $135,000. Not bad for 3 1/2 months!  I now have a boat load of cash. The question is what to do now.” Dale B. 9/03
