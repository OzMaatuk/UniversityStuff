Renowned Satellite Industry Expert Dr. Arthur R. Tilford Joins MB Tech


BREAKING NEWS - (PRIMEZONE) - MB Tech, Inc. (OTC.BB: MBTT) announces that Dr. Arthur R. Tilford,
formerly with Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH), has been retained by the Company to provide technical
consulting and advisory services.

Tilford is an aerospace industry veteran responsible for a total of 11 patents and patent
applications within the field, having received Hughes' Chairman's Award for DirecDuo, solo
engineering efforts in 1997. He is an expert system designer and Federal Licensing and Certifying
Engineer. He has authored several books, including Satellite Fieldbook Quarterly(c) -- Hughes S&C,
CA, the contents of which describe all parameters of every C/Ku band geo-satellite in the world and
the over 400 page Satellite Workbook(c) for use in satellite engineering classes, taught by him, at
the California State University (CSUF at CSULB).

Tilford worked with Netune Communications, where he was responsible for providing transponder
allocations, domestic and international link-budget calculations for narrow to very-wide-band
satellite system and writing, calculating and applying for FCC and RA transmit licenses.

He also assigned parameters for RF sub-system design and is an expert in radiation hazard
compliance.

Hanwook Bae, President of MB Tech, commented, ``The importance of Dr. Tilford joining the Company
cannot be underestimated. He is an industry leader with numerous patents relating to antenna design
and an immense knowledge of the satellite Internet market. His incredible technical knowledge will
allow us to dramatically step up our new initiatives, catapulting us to the forefront of our
industry.'' He added, ``This is yet another positive step forward in the overall paradigm shift for
the Company. We have moved from being a manufacturer of satellite components, to a Company that will
lead the consumer satellite electronics industry.''




STOCK PROFILE OF THE WEEK

MB Tech is a global manufacturer and distributor of satellite components. The primary product MB
Tech produces is "LNB" (Low-Noise Blockdown) converters, which are the essential element enabling
DBS satellites to receive and convert satellite transmission signals. MB Tech currently serves the
satellite television market, and is expanding to serve the satellite radio and military hardware
sectors. MB Tech manufactures several proprietary LNB solutions that differentiate it from
competitors. MB Tech's product line includes a dual-horn LNB which allows multiple set-top boxes to
be connected to a single satellite dish, enabling viewing of multiple channels simultaneously on
different television monitors, and a tri-horn LNB, which provides the ability to download signals
from multiple satellites over a single dish.



TECHNOLOGY

MB Tech has improved on conventional designs and can manufacture units more efficiently and less
expensively than the competition. MB Tech specializes in LNB electronics, it is the ONLY thing we
do.


An LNB converter transforms the satellite transmission into a useable signal. MB Tech has developed
a special new breed of LNB converter which allows the signal to feed separate televisions or other
'boxes' with different channels. The signal coming in from one dish can be distributed through MB
Tech's 'dual and triple horned' LNB converter such that multiple channels can be viewed, or
different channels and Internet access can be delivered.. ALL AT THE SAME TIME!


Other technological objectives have been to develop LNB for G.P.S. equipment, and small type two
horn technology as well as UBC DSS type LNB. These objectives have been achieved and the Company is
currently speaking with larger American based technology companies about the technology.




PRODUCTS

MB Tech products are innovative! We rely on superior technology to be an integral part of our
business. We have made a serious committment to ongoing R&D to stay ahead of the curve.

MB Tech, Inc traces its roots back to 2000 with the development of 3 types of LNB (DSS type).
Continuous reinvention and rapid transformation are themes throughout our history. Led by our
top-notch technology, our company offered a new breed of satellite broadcasting solutions to
clients?solutions that customized LNB with 3 or 4 horns.

Within the next two years, MB Tech will spend over 80 million dollars on continuing Research and
development of our products. We will continue a process of product renewal that will assure products
with features and functionality that will be attractive to the market.




MDI: MERRILL LYNCH COMENTS ON AD TRENDS IN THE MEDIA SECTOR

Merrill Lynch surveyed newspapers, TV stations and radio stations to try to understand the divergent
trends between local and national advertising in the current recovery. They noted that U.S. ad
expenditures tend to keep pace with or slightly outperform the economy over time. As such, the rise
of media outlets should not necessarily lead to higher ad spending but most likely to market share
shifts among the mediums. The surveys showed that local cable is becoming a more competitive force,
but overall, they found no major structural issues impacting the dynamics between local and national
ad spending.

Merrill noted that national advertisers typically base their budgets on projected economic trends
and therefore can afford to spend a bit ahead of a turn in the cycle. However, local advertisers,
with more limited resources, are more likely to lag in spending coming out of a recovery as they
need to see an immediate return on investment. They pointed out that a better economy should
eliminate the differences.

The firm believes there are many positive themes occurring with newspapers today (e.g. collaborative
selling efforts, product innovation, renewed focus on readership) that are being masked by the
downturn in department store spending, which appears to be secular, and the cyclical issue of help
wanted, which is finally turning positive.

>From a consumer perspective, they believe radio is a relatively protected medium. However, the
industry remains beset with excess inventory, following unsustainable demand in the late 1990's. A
reduction in spots and/or lower prices could limit near term growth, yet support long term growth,
giving investors something to chase.

TV is about to enter the growth phase of its two year cycle, but its low growth, single revenue
stream is likely the main target for local cable TV and should also be impacted by increased DVR
