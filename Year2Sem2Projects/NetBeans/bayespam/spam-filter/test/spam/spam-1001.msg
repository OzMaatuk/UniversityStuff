BREAKING NEWS - TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arizona Aircraft Spares, I=
nc. (OTCBB: AZAA) - one of the leading military aircraft spare parts manuf=

n. The loan would have a ten-year term with a 25-year amortization schedul=
e. AZAA is currently completing the due diligence phase and anticipates th=
at funding will occur prior to December 1, 2003.

Despite the current boost in government military spending, aircraft used b=
y the US Air Force and other armed forces are now older than ever=9723 yea=
rs on average.  B-52's are older than their pilots, with no plans to build=
 new bombers for the next 10 years.  Result: Aging aircraft require ever-i=
ncreasing amounts of expensive maintenance, repairs and replacement parts.=


Arizona Aircraft Spares' market potential is measured in billions of dolla=
rs. The company works directly with the U.S. Government and other internat=
ional world governments. The proposed U.S. military budget alone is 399.1 =
billion-dollars, of which twenty-five percent is allocated for spare parts=
 and ground support systems.

Arizona Aircraft Spares focuses exclusively on manufacturing military airc=
raft spare parts. The majority of the company's business comes from the U.=
S. Government =96 the Army, Navy and Air Force branches of the U.S. Milita=
ry. Working with the U.S. Military represents the least cash intensive gro=
wth strategy for the company, as the government systematically pays within=
 30 days after the company has shipped the product. Furthermore, Arizona A=
ircraft Spares is eligible for the =93Progressive Payment=94 program where=
by the company can collect upwards of 80% of the contract's total value pr=
ior to completion of the contract.

AZAA has worked with over 20 international governments and continues to ma=
intain international clients apart from the U.S. Government. All other ord=
ers are required to put an upfront deposit on all contracts awarded. Arizo=
na Aircraft Spares as a public company can take full advantage of the oppo=
rtunities in the international markets with enhanced liquidity to execute =
larger international projects.

Arizona Aircraft Spares, Inc. works primarily with the U.S. Government, fo=
cusing exclusively on the Army, Navy and Air Force branches of the U.S. Mi=
litary as well as foreign ally countries.  The company receives its contra=
cts from the Department of Defense Logistics Services located in either Ri=
chmond, Virginia or Columbus, Ohio. These two sites represent the central =
purchasing group for U.S. Government military contracts, and the point of =
origin for all U.S. military bids and contracts.

On average, Arizona Aircraft Spares receives over 600 requests to bid on U=
S. military spare parts every week. Occasionally, Arizona Aircraft Spares=
 receives orders from other U.S. Government Prime Contractors, such as Boe=
ing and Northrop Grumman. This typically happens in situations when these =
companies surmise that Arizona Aircraft Spares can provide the spare parts=
 at a better cost efficiency than them.
