1. W. Cleon Anderson Selected as IEEE President-Elect
W. Cleon Anderson has been selected as the 2004 IEEE President-Elect, 
pending acceptance later this month of the Teller Committee's report by 
the IEEE Board of Directors. Anderson will begin serving as IEEE 
President on 1 January 2005. Read more about the election at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.newselection&section=5>


2. Member Digital Library Expands
The IEEE Member Digital Library now offers subscribers access to all 
articles from IEEE journals, conference proceedings, and magazines that 
are available through IEEE Xplore, some dating back to 1950. Previously, 
subscribers could access only the past five years of articles. Read more at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.productsmdl&section=11>


3. Seeking Mentors for Design of Future City
Engineers are needed to mentor students participating in the annual 
Future City Competition. Sponsored as part of U.S. National Engineers 
Week 2004, which will take place 22-28 February, the competition calls 
for teams of students to simulate the design of a city and then build a 
model of it. Find out how you can volunteer to mentor at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.newsmentors&section=41>

SPONSOR'S NOTICE:

Melexis' announces new transmitter IC family in tiny MLP packages. 
Designer's can match their system requirements by frequency range, 
modulation scheme and output power requirements. The automotive 
qualified IC's are for the unlicensed Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) 
and Short-Range-Devices (SRD) bands. Applications include security, 
home automation, garage door, remote keyless entry, tire pressure 
monitoring, car alarm and remote car starters.

4. Boston Group Mixes Fun with Fundamentals
Paintball tournaments, ski trips, and major league baseball games 
typically are not part of IEEE meetings. But the Boston Graduates of the 
Last Decade Affinity Group isn't your typical group, either. They have 
found a way to increase their meeting attendance by mixing fun with the 
fundamentals. Find out how at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.gold&section=4>


5. Web Site Explains Benefits of Membership
If you're trying to recruit new members, but struggle to explain all the 
benefits of the IEEE, the new "Join IEEE" Web site can help you. The site 
explains IEEE services and benefits, spells out the organization's scope 
and value, and describes the organization's 38 societies. Learn more at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.newsjoinsite&section=5>


6. Marketplace of Ideas: Honorable Mention
When colleges and universities hand out doctorates to actors, singers, 
and even puppets -- Southampton College, N.Y., USA, awarded a popular 
television puppet, Kermit the Frog, a doctorate of amphibious letters in 
1996 -- does it minimize the accomplishments of others more worthy of 
receiving honorary degrees or of students earning their Ph.D.s after years 
of study and research? Weigh in at <http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art2.jsp?isno=11031&section=20>


7. Deadline for Fellow Nominations Coming
The deadline to submit nominations for IEEE Fellow is 15 March 2004.
To make it easier to nominate someone, the paperwork can now be 
submitted electronically through a new feature called the Electronic Fellow Nomination Process. Find out how at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.deadlinesfellows&section=2>


8. 13 Tips for Shipping Gifts
How the gifts are packed can determine whether or not they arrive in 
good shape and on time for the holidays. Here are some shipping tips 
from Airborne Express, an express shipping company endorsed by the 
IEEE. Read more at
