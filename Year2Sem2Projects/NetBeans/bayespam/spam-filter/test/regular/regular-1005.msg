Dear MARIUS BULACU;


Time is running out to renew your IEEE membership for 2004.

Don't miss out! Renew today online at <http://www.ieee.org/renewal>. It's quick and easy.

Renew by 14 November 2003 and IEEE will enter you into a drawing to win a new Dell Notebook Computer.*

As you plan for the 2004 membership year, you can also use the online renewal site at <http://www.ieee.org/renewal> to review an informative guide to customizing your membership. Here, you will find details on the 38 IEEE Societies, additional membership benefits, first-rate IEEE technical publications and the IEEE Member Digital Library - now with expanded access to all IEEE titles back to 1988, and select titles to 1950.

Any questions? Please contact IEEE Member Services at:

We look forward to serving you this year and for years to come.
