2 PhD positions + 1 Scientific Programmer position

Vacancy numbers:
2823.2003210    2 PhD positions
2823.2003211    1 scientific programmer position


The Computational Intelligence Group of the Department of Mathematics and
Computer Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, seeks two PhD students and
one Scientific Programmer for a 4-year research project DIANA (Data
Stream Mining). This ICT-breakthrough project is financed by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (SENTER) and involves an extensive cooperation with
several companies.

The main objective of the DIANA project is to develop a new technology for
building adaptive systems that intercept huge streams of data, analyze
them in real-time and provide some useful feedback. This technology can be
used for building a new generation of systems for fraud detection with
electronic transactions, detection of misuse of complex information
systems, network intrusion detection, gathering "business intelligence",
etc.

Tasks
Development of new algorithms for mining data streams (machine learning,
neural networks, statistics).
Development of a methodology for maintaining complex, self-learning
systems.
Development of a generic framework for mining data streams.
Evaluation of the framework in a real-life business environment.

Job requirements
PhD positions: The candidates should have a MSc degree in Artificial
Intelligence, Computer Science, Mathematics, or similar and have an
extensive background in machine learning, data mining, and statistics. Any
experience with analyzing big data sets is a pre. Also some programming
skills are needed.

Scientific Programmer: The candidate should have an extensive experience
with Unix (or Linux) operating system, have several years of experience
with programming in C/C++ and Java, be fluent in some scripting languages
like Perl or Python, and know some database management systems like MySQL
or Oracle. Additionally, the candidate should know some software packages
for data analysis like Matlab, S-Plus, SPSS, SAS, etc. This position is in
principle for 3 years with a perspective of an extension for one more
year.

Salary
Successful candidates will be employed for four years starting preferably
1 January 2004. The salary is according to the standards for PhD students
and is ranging between ? 1683,-- during the first year and ? 2283,--
during the fourth year in the case of a full-time appointment.
The salary range for a scientific programmer is, depending on experience,
between ? 2394,-- and ? 3046,--.

Information and applications
Further information can be obtained from the project leader, dr. Wojtek
Kowalczyk (phone +31-20-4447695; e-mail wojtek@cs.vu.nl) or the head of
Computational Intelligence Group, prof.dr. A.E. Eiben, (phone
+31-20-4447758; e-mail gusz@cs.vu.nl).

Applications accompanied by curriculum vitae with preferably the names
and e-mail addresses of at least 2 professional references should be sent
within two weeks after the publication of this advertisement to:
Mrs. S. Bongaarts, head of the personnel department of the Faculty of
Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1081a, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The
Netherlands, with mentioning of the vacancynumber, or by e-mail:
