Dear all,

At the new website of BCN are a lot of PhD-abstracts. 
Unfortunately not all of the PhD abstracts are mentioned.

I herewith like to ask you to send in your abstract for the website 
as soon as possible.
In case you have one sent in for the posterpresentation that is 
suitable for the website, let us know that that abstract can be 
used. 
Please send it to Diana: D.H.Koopmans@med.rug.nl

Greetings,
Tinie Alma
