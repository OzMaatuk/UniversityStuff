Neurofederation and hES cell debate in EP

Together with NWO, ZonMw, VSOP, KNAW, FBG, VSNU, Nefarma, Biofarmid 
and VNO-NCW, the Neurofederation has called upon the Dutch members of 
the European Parliament (EP) to vote against amendments that would 
ban the use of human embryonic stem (hES) cells for research towards 
human application for tissue repair and against a block of EU funding 
for research projects in this field. 
See http://www.neurofederatie.nl/news for the complete text and more 
information.

ZonMw launched ProjectNet

ZonMw goes digital for your grant applications. You can present your 
proposal on-line via the internet ProjectNet page
