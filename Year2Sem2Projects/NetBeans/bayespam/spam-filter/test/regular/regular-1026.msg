1. When Disaster Strikes, IEEE Members Take Action
Wilderness survival skills were not part of Member Charles H. Chapman's
job description as a NASA computer engineer, but that changed last
February when he found himself combing the rugged east Texas terrain
for debris from the NASA space shuttle Columbia. Read more about
Chapman and other IEEE members who came to the rescue after a
disaster at
