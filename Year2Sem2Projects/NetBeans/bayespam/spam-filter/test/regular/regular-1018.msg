Today I had to make a pdf-file for some other course, and to my horror
I found out that something has gone wrong. The same thing has happened
with my submission last friday, I'm afraid!!

I 'solved' the problems (I'm not sure how it could have happened or what
happend :() and sent you my work again.

I hope you are willing to accept this.
