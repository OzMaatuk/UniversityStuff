Third International Workshop on
SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE DESIGN: SID 2004
July 3-5, 2004

CALL FOR PAPERS
 
University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands
Conference website: http://parlevink.cs.utwente.nl/sid04.html

This is the third workshop on the subject of social intelligence design
focused on the significance of  information technology in our lives,
work, home, and on the move. In this workshop we consider Social
Intelligence (SI) as the ability for people to relate to, understand and
interact effectively with others.  Our particular concern is how SI is
mediated through the use of new technologies. 

Main Themes:
1. INTERACTIONS - covering theory, modelling and analytical frameworks
that have been developed with Social  Intelligence Design in mind.
2. COMMUNITIES covering community media, communication patterns in
online communities, knowledge-creating,  network and anonymous
communities.
3. COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES and tools - covering innovations to
support interactions within communities,  covering a range from
knowledge sharing systems, multi-agent systems, interactive systems,
embodied  conversational agents.
4. APPLICATION DOMAINS - including architecture, education, policy and
business.

Intended Participants:
This workshop is intended for all who are concerned with the impact of
advanced information and  communication technologies on social
intelligence, in particular, researchers, developers and designers of
new ways of  communicating enabled and supported by such technologies.
The contributions will be published  in the workshop proceedings.  
 
Please visit the (preliminary) conference website:

History of the SID workshops:
This is the third workshop on the subject of social intelligence design
focused on the significance of  information technology in our lives,
work, home, and on the move.

The first workshop, held in Matsue, Japan in 2001, opened up key themes
in this area, namely, how new  technologies mediate human communication
and collaboration across geographical and cultural divides. The  post
workshop proceedings edited by Takao Terano, Toyoaki Nishida, Akira
Namatame, Yukio Ohsawa, Shusaku  Tsumoto, and Takashi Washio can be
viewed on http://mailer.kc.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/synsophy/sid2001/. Selected
papers from the first SID workshop of the Japanese Society of Artificial
Intelligence were published in  Lecture Notes on Artificial Intelligence
LNAI 2253, Springer Verlag, December 2001.

The second workshop was held in Egham, United Kingdom in 2003. For
information visit the workshop's website:
http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Management/News-and-Events/conferences/SID2003/
The 2nd workshop identified the following two main themes:
*  The ability of a collection of actors/agents to learn and solve as a
function of social structure;
*  The ability of an actor/agent to manage relationships with other
actors/agents that act intelligently in  a society.

The four main themes (Natural Interaction, Communities, Collaboration
Technologies, and Application Domains)  of the third workshop, SID 2004,
have been chosen to cover these issues from theoretical, technological
and application  viewpoints.
