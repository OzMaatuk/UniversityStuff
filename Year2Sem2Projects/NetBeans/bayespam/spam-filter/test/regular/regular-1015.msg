A word about the links in this email:
We had hoped to shorten the URLs beginning with this newsletter, 
however, technical issues are forcing a delay. We appreciate your 
patience. Meanwhile, please note that the complete link, contained 
between the < > symbols, should be selected when clicking 
or copying and pasting into a browser window. 


1. Students Travel the Ethical Road
Ethics, or the lack of it, has brought a lot of business big shots into the 
courtroom lately. Many wonder whether business schools even teach 
ethics. Within the IEEE, some wonder just how far ethical considerations 
are imbued in students of engineering. To gain insight, the IEEE St. Louis 
Section (Missouri, USA) sponsored a competition centered around ethical 
considerations. Read more about the competition at 
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.ethics&section=4>


2. Past President a Shining Light in Canada's Electricity Industry
When IEEE Life Fellow and 1996 President Wallace S. Read talks to 
engineers, he advises them that part of their responsibility is to repay their 
profession and society. Read has done just that and next month he will be 
honored with his country's highest award. Learn more about Read's life at
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.profile&section=15>


3. Conference Attracts Researchers to Magnets
Coming in January, the 9th Joint International Magnetics and Magnetism 
and Magnetic Materials Conference, better known as the Joint Intermag 
MMM, will feature the latest applications of magnetics to such areas as 
nanotechnology, biomedicine, and spintronics. Find out more about the 
conference at
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.conference&section=42>

4. 2003 Magnetics Conference Proceedings Report Latest Breakthroughs
The conference proceedings of the 2003 Intermag meeting will help get 
you up to speed on the latest advances in the magnetics field. Last year's 
conference covered topics ranging from magnetic semiconductors, 
transformers, and motors to micromagnetics, nanocrystalline materials, 
and magnetic sensors. The proceedings are available through the IEEE 
Online Catalog & Store at 
<http://shop.ieee.org>


5. Canadian Students Improve Recruitment to Biomedical Engineering
Student Members in Canada have found new ways to attract high school 
students to the field of biomedical engineering and to the IEEE. Learn 
about the Canadian students' methods at
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.featureBME&section=4>


6. Deadline Extended for IEEE Computer Society Design Competition
The deadline for entries in the 5th annual Computer Society International 
Design Competition has been extended to 2 December. This year's 
theme is "Making the World a Safer Place." The goal is to advance 
excellence in education by having student teams design and implement 
computer-based solutions to real-world problems. Read more about the 
competition at
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=10031&arnumber=10031_10w.deadlinecsidc&section=41>


7. See Your Awards, Honors, and Recognitions in The Institute
If you've received an award or other recognition from your government or 
employer, let other members know about it by notifying The Institute. 
Every month The Institute publishes notices of IEEE members' 
achievements in government, academia, and industry. Submissions 
should contain the member's name, city, state or province, country, IEEE 
membership grade, the name of the recognition, and its significance, if 
appropriate. Read this month's member recognitions at
<http://www.theinstitute.ieee.org/inst_art.jsp?isno=11031&arnumber=11031_11w.memrecog&section=17>


8. Register with the IEEE Job Site and Get a Free Posting
During November, register the name of your organization's recruitment 
manager at <http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jobsite/hrmanagerform> and 
your group will receive one free "Help Wanted" job posting for 30 days. 
The IEEE Job Site staff will contact each manager to help prepare the 
listing. The IEEE Job Site is at
