;; Question 1.1
;; the ready function string makes a string from charecters
(: append5 : Char Char Char Char Char -> String)
;; append5 gets 5 charecters
;; and output a string
;; which is all the chars together
(define (append5 a b c d e)
  	(string a b c d e))
(test (append5 #\e #\d #\c #\b #\a) => "edcba")
(test (append5 #\a #\2 #\c #\D #\^) => "a2cD^")

;; Question 1.2
;; the function makes any combination of 3 charecters as string
;; by creating all the posible options
(: permute3 : Char Char Char -> (List String String String String String String))
;; permute3 gets 3 chrecters
;; and output a list of strings
(define (permute3 a b c)
  (list (string a b c) (string b a c) (string b c a) (string c b a) (string c a b) (string a c b)))
;; this is more efficien to solve this by placing the chars then recursivly
(test (permute3 #\a #\b #\c) =>'("abc" "bac" "bca" "cba" "cab" "acb"))
(test (permute3 #\1 #\r #\^) =>'("1r^" "r1^" "r^1" "^r1" "^1r" "1^r"))

;; Question 2
;; the function recursuvly go over evety element in the list
;; use ready length function for checking if it list of three elements
;; counts every time that it equal
(: count-3lists : (Listof(Listof Any)) ->  Integer)
;; count-3lists gets a list of lists with any value
;; and output the number of inner lists that got 3 elements

;; Question 4
